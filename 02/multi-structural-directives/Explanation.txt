How to use *ngIf and *ngSwitch together

How it works…


Since we can't use two structural directives on a single element, we can always use 
another HTML element as a parent to use the other structural directive. However, that 
adds another element to the DOM and might cause problems for your element hierarchy, 
based on your implementation. <ng-container>, however, is a magical element 
from Angular's core that is not added to the DOM. Instead, it just wraps the logic/
condition that you apply to it, which makes it really easy for us to just add a *ngIf or 
*ngSwitchCase directive on top of your existing elements.
