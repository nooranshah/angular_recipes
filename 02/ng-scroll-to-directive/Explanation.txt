Creating a basic directive that allows you to 
vertically scroll to an element

How it works…
The essence of this recipe is the web API that we're using within an Angular directive, and 
that is Element.scrollIntoView(). We first attach our appScrollTo directive 
to the elements that should trigger scrolling upon clicking them. We also specify which 
element to scroll to by using the target input for each directive attached. Then, we 
implement the click handler inside the directive with the scrollIntoView() method 
to scroll to a particular target, and to use a smooth animation while scrolling, we pass the 
{behavior: 'smooth'} object as an argument to the scrollIntoView() method.
