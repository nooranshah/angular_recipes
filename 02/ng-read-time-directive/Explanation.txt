Creating a directive to calculate the read time 
for articles
In this recipe, you'll create an attribute directive to calculate the read time of an article, 
just like Medium. The code for this recipe is highly inspired by my existing repository 
on GitHub, which you can view at the following link: https://github.com/

How it works…
The appReadTime directive is at the heart of this recipe. We use the ElementRef
service inside the directive to get the native element that the directive is attached to, then 
we take out its text content. The only thing that remains then is to perform the calculation. 
We first split the entire text content into words by using the /\s+/g regular expression
(regex), and thus we count the total words in the text content. Then, we divide the word 
count by the wordsPerMinute value we have in the configuration to calculate how 
many minutes it would take to read the entire text. Easy peasy, lemon squeezy.
